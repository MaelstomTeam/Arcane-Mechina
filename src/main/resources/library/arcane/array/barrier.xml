	<text>creating an Etheric rune with a basic circle with valiant markers in each of the 4 cardinal directions seems to have created a barrier against all entities</text>
	<text>although one had to sacrifice a §4shield§r, 2 §4Etheric Crystals§r and an §4Ender Pearl§r to get this desired effect, but nothing an decent alchemist can't handle</text>
	<text>note: it appears adding an inventory above the circle changes the effected entities</text>
	<text>§4Golden Nuggets§r seems to effect neutral mobs</text>
	<text>§4Rotten Flesh§r appears to have a similar effect upon hostile creatures</text>
	<text>interestingly enough §4Wheat§r pushes in passive mobs</text>
