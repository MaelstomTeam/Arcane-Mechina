	<text>The Sub-Sonic Screwdriver is a marvel of technology. Bound to its user, it will be able to imitate most modern tools. for instance everybody's favorite wrench can be emulated by such a device!</text>
	<text>Unfortunately it is unable to emulate magical items for the specific reason of being unable to reproduce such effects using science. funnily enough it doesn't work on wood, which rules out quiet a lot of botanical uses but that being said this is the current state of the device and may change in the years to come!</text>
